**Hello! My name is Alan Mizener, and I am an MD/PhD student at West Virginia University.**

I am currently hard at work on my PhD in Cancer Cell Biology, where my research explores the intricate mechanisms behind and potential treatments for breast cancer-induced skeletal muscle fatigue. In our lab, we’re excited to be running a Phase 2 clinical trial testing whether pioglitazone, a commonly used diabetes drug, can help alleviate fatigue in breast cancer patients. If you want to learn more, check out our clinical trial on [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05013255?cond=Breast%20Cancer&intr=pioglitazone&rank=1).

I strive to become a surgical oncologist and physician scientist. My goal is to harness the latest molecular and analytical techniques to push the boundaries of oncology care and improve outcomes for *all* patients. I’m committed to advancing our understanding of cancer and finding innovative ways to enhance patient care.
