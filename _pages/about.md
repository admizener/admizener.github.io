Hello! My name is Alan Mizener, and I am an MD/PhD student at West Virginia University.

I am currently working on my PhD in Cancer Cell Biology. My research focuses on mechanisms and treatments for breast cancer induced skeletal muscle fatigue. My lab is currently running a phase 2 clinical trial invetigating the use of the diabetes drug, pioglitazone, as a treatment for fatigue in breast cancer patients. You can read more about our clinical trial on [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05013255?cond=Breast%20Cancer&intr=Pioglitazone&rank=1).

My ultimate career goal is to become a surgical oncologist and physician scientist. I am dedicated to levaraging cutting-edge molecular and analytical techniques to advancing oncology care for all patients.
